A encryptor to encrypt files using passwords.

## Features

- Can encrypt any files
- Can encrypt folder (**Experimental**, use at own risk)
- Only AES encryption is available right now.

**Tip**: To encrypt a folder, create a tarball of the folder then encrypt it (**Recommanded**)

```sh
tar -cf folder.tar folder
```

## Usage

Encrypt a file,

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt "filename"
```

Decrypt a file,

```sh
go-encryptor decrypt "filename"
```

Use k flag in both `encrypt` & `decrypt` to keep the file.

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt -k "filename"
```

or

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt --keep "filename"
```
