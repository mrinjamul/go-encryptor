A encryptor to encrypt files using passwords.

## Features

- Can encrypt any file or folder
- AES-256 encryption
- Password based encryption
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption

**Tip**: To encrypt folders, create a tarball of the folder then encrypt it (**Recommanded**)

```sh
tar -cf folder.tar folder ...
```

## Build

To build the application, you need to have Go installed on your machine.

```sh
go build
```

## Usage

Encrypt a file,

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt "filename"
```

Decrypt a file,

```sh
go-encryptor decrypt "filename"
```

Use k flag in both `encrypt` & `decrypt` to keep the file.

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt -k "filename"
```

or

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt --keep "filename"
```

## More

Encrypt a file with a specific encryption method using a password,

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt --method "aes" --password "password" "filename"
```

or

```sh
go-encryptor encrypt -m "aes" -p "password" "filename"
```

Decrypt a file and print the output to stdout and pipe it to another command,

```sh
go-encryptor decrypt -p "password" --print "filename" | [command]
```

```
